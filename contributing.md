# Guide to contribute (very short, but pay attention)

Let's make it simple.

If you like the theme and want to contribute to bring the features you want or fix problems you is having, you should:

  1. Write an issue with the label "contribute request". You can choose other labels too, example: if you want to make a new feature, you can mark "contribute request" and "enhancement" labels, but that's not required;

  2. Tell in what you want to work on, what changes you want to make. Please, make it short and easy to understand;

  3. I will see your ask for contribute issue, and if there's no problem with it, i will let you know, so you can start coding;

  4. Follow the current files workflow or, if necessary, create you owns in a way that makes sense;

  5. When finished with your changes, send a pull request in a different branch, would be easier if you name it the same name as the original issue;

  6. I will review it, if that's okay, I can merge the changes.
