# Warning !

If you was using the theme, you probably noticed that it broke due to discord updates. I took the chance and started developing it again, in a way more clean. **This version is not equal to the old one**, since the theme is being developed again some things might be broken or not styled yet.

# Installation

Download the theme navigating to [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datsfilipe/smooth-theme/main/src/theme/smooth.theme.css) and pressing `ctrl + s` or `cmd + s`.
