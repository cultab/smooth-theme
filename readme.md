# Smooth Theme

> **Warning**
> 
> **Theme Development**: After trying to add the theme again on BetterDiscord (***because of their platform not updating the theme file version ðŸ¥²***) and being refused by the reson of the theme looking the same as others (***it was accepeted and was available before so wtf?***) the development will not continue and the repository will be archived forever. As a side note, my account has not been verified on their platform, but it still appears as a contributor on their website ðŸ« .

## Installation
